# Kachemak Bay Marine Wrack Long-term Study

###### README LAST UPDATED: 2025/04/30

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a repository under active development to quantify marine wrack and associated communities in Kachemak Bay, Alaska. It is based on [Ulaski et al. 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141113623000983) with the goal of extending the seasonal time-series and increasing the temporal resolution established in that study. This project has been in partnership with the Kachemak Bay Campus Semester By The Bay Internship program.

### Objectives

-   Create a long-term dataset of marine wrack deposition

-   Identify and characterize species associations with marine wrack, including birds and invertebrates

### Guiding Questions

-   How much marine wrack washes up on the shores of Kachemak Bay?

-   What is the composition of the wrack and how does it change on an annual and inter-annual basis?

-   What services does marine wrack provide to nearshore communities?

### Current Status

This project is in active development with quarterly updates to primary datasets. Wrack cover and presence/absence characterization are currently collected on a minimum-monthly basis. Additional methods, analyses, and an expanded scope of the project are underway. Short-term goals of the project include:

-   Develop quantitative methods for wrack composition identification

-   Standardize bird surveys for inclusion with the dataset

-   Develop tractable invertebrate collection and identification methods

-   Expand the geographic scope of the study area to include other beaches

-   Collate and incorporate environmental parameters into analyses including wind, tide, and precipitation data
